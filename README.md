## **Project Motivation**
This Github repo is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

In this project, I used Seattle Airbnb Open Data. This dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

This dataset includes the following Airbnb activity:

- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

This project focuses on answering the following questions:

- What are the most common verifications from host in the listings ?
- How different types of features attract the guests for renting a homestay ?
- What are the most influential features affect the price of homestays in Seattle ?
