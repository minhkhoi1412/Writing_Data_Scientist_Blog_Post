## **Project Motivation**
This Github repo is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

In this project, I used Seattle Airbnb Open Data. This dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

This dataset includes the following Airbnb activity:

- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

This project focuses on answering the following questions:

- What are the most common verifications from hosts in the listings?
- How do different types of features attract the guests for renting a homestay?
- What are the most influential features that affect the price of homestays in Seattle?


## **File Descriptions**

- seattle_airbnb_analysis.ipynb notebook contains a complete analysis to answer the questions and clearly explains them with visualizations.
- listings.csv file located in dataset/seattle_airbnb folder is the original dataset in csv format


## **Usage**

- Install all packages using requirements.txt file. This is the command to install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Run all cells in the notebook file.


## **Results**

The main findings can be found at the Medium blog post I have written [here](https://medium.com/@neo.nxmk/a-quick-peek-into-the-airbnb-activity-in-seattle-e7cfd21c18).
